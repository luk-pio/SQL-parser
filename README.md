# SQL-parser
Right now the "pretty printer" implements a rather small subset of sql. It includes:
- basic select with expressions and nested expressions
- basic select options (ALL, DISTINCT etc)
- select ... from ...;

First time writing anything in c so... Please don't be too disgusted :D Pretty different coming from a python world. But fun as all hell.

git clone https://github.com/luk-pio/SQL-parser.git
cd SQL-parser
make sql test
